# Fix Prisma Database Issues

## ✅ Progress Update
- [x] **Prisma Client Issue**: Fixed - Now connecting to PostgreSQL correctly
- [ ] **Missing Tables**: Need to create database tables in Neon

## Current Issue
The `public.projects` table doesn't exist in your Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Final Solution
Run these commands to create the missing tables:

```bash
# 1. Push your schema to create the missing tables
npx prisma db push

# 2. Verify the tables were created
npx prisma studio
```

## Alternative: Reset and Migrate
If `db push` doesn't work, try this:

```bash
# Reset and create fresh migration
npx prisma migrate reset --force
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## What This Creates
Your schema will create these tables:
- `projects` - For storing project data
- `project_technologies` - For project technology tags

## Test Connection
After running the commands, test with:
```bash
# Check if tables exist
npx prisma studio
```

## Your Current Setup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) ✅
- **Connection**: Working ✅  
- **Schema**: Correct ✅
- **Tables**: Missing ❌ (this is what we're fixing)

## Expected Result
After running `npx prisma db push`, you should see:
```
✅ Your database is now in sync with your schema
```
